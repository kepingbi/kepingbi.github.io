**Keping Bi**, Associate Professor at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)

> My research centers on **[Trustworthy Information Access](https://stay-hungry-time.github.io/)**, aiming to advance information access systems that are not only effective, but also *reliable, transparent, and aligned with human values*. As large language models increasingly mediate how people search for, consume, and act on information, I investigate how LLM-based information access systems can be designed to behave **honestly, helpfully, and harmlessly**, while operating responsibly within the broader information ecosystem.
>
> My work spans information retrieval, retrieval-augmented generation, agentic search, and model robustness, with a particular focus on understanding and mitigating implicit bias, source bias. 
>
> I earned my Ph.D. from the College of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Massachusetts (UMass) Amherst, under the guidance of Professor [W. Bruce Croft](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/croft) at the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR)](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/). I also hold two master's degrees—one in computer science from UMass Amherst and another in machine intelligence from Peking University—and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Nankai University.

**Recruiting**

I'm recruiting self-motivated master students who are interested in conducting innovative research. Undergraduate students who are willing to pursue a Ph.D. or master degree in Institute of Computing Technology CAS or abroad are welcome to do internships in my group. If you are interested, please send your resume to my email address (bikeping[at]ict.ac.cn) and include your research interests and your future plan.
